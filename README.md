# Çağrı Okan — Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website!  
Here, I share my **past and ongoing experiences**, **education**, **projects**, and more —  
think of it as my digital portfolio.

## 🧭 Overview

This project serves as a central hub for everything I’ve worked on — designed, built, and written by me.

I’m open to **suggestions** and **issues**,  
but this repo isn’t intended for direct contributions —  
after all, it’s a *personal* website.
